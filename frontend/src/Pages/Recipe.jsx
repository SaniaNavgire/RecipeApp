                                In a bowl, mix all marinade ingredients with the chicken.
                                Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (overnight for best flavor).
                                <b>Step:2</b> Cook the Rice
                                Boil water with bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, and ghee.
                                Add soaked rice and cook until it's 70% cooked (grains should still be firm).
                                Drain the rice and keep it aside.
                                <b>Step 3:</b>Cook the Chicken
                                Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan, add sliced onions, and fry until golden brown.

                                Sprinkle coriander, mint leaves, and saffron-soaked milk on top.
                                Add the remaining rice as a second layer and repeat the toppings.
